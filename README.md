# Computer Vision Object Detection Projects

### This Is a repository built to walk through various Object Detection Tasks and Learn from them.
### The objective of this repository is not just to copy&paste the code from the Kaggle(everyone can do itðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜…); it is to write down each code, alter it and maybe enhance it in a way that can be more straightforward to comprehend.


### Some challenges are so long that they can't be represented in GitHub, so I have to separate them into several parts.

### you can get more details about Object Recognition in my articles in medium:
