<!-- # Computer Vision Projects

### This Is a repository built to walk through various Object Detection Tasks and Learn from them.

###### Some challenges are too long that they can't be represented in a single GitHub code, so I have to separate them into several parts.


### you can get more details about Object Recognition in my articles in medium:

There are 2 articles, 
one implemented by Tensorflow, and the other one is implemented by PoTorch.

# Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains a collection of computer vision projects implemented using various libraries and frameworks. Each project has its own directory and contains a README file with detailed information on how to set up and run the project.

## Projects

- **Face Recognition:** A face recognition system that uses OpenCV and Haar Cascades to detect faces and recognize them using a pre-trained SVM model.
- **Object Tracking:** An object tracking system that uses OpenCV and the KCF algorithm to track objects in a video stream.
- **Image Classification:** An image classification system that uses TensorFlow and a pre-trained Inception V3 model to classify images into different categories.
- **Lane Detection:** A lane detection system that uses OpenCV and Hough Transform to detect and draw lanes on a road.
- **Gesture Recognition:** A gesture recognition system that uses OpenCV and a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize hand gestures.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects, simply navigate to the project directory and follow the instructions in the project's README file. Each project has its own set of dependencies and requirements, so make sure to install those before running the project.

## Dependencies

The projects in this repository require various libraries and frameworks, including OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras. Make sure to install all the necessary dependencies before running any of the projects. You can install the dependencies using pip or conda.
