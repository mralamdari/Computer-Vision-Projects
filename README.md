# Computer Vision Object Detection Projects

### This Is a repository built to walk through various Object Detection Tasks and Learn from them.

###### Some challenges are so long that they can't be represented in GitHub, so I have to separate them into several parts.


### you can get more details about Object Recognition in my articles in medium:
There are 2 articles, one implemented by Tensorflow, and the other one is implemented by PoTorch.
